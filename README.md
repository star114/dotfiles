# dotfiles

My dotfiles, with a lot taken from others

Requires:

- [vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) 
    - [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen)
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash)
    - [git-aware-prompt](https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt)

This uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot), which is added as a submodule.
